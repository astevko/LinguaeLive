<div class="{style.sectionHeader}"> Privacy Policy </div>
<p class="{style.sectionItalic}">This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how LinguaeLive, LLC collects and uses the personal information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using the LinguaeLive service located at www.LinguaeLive.ca (the "Website").</p>

The Website uses session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, the Website uses a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to the Website. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
<p class="{style.sectionDesc}">You post content in the form of text, files, images, photos, works of authorship, any other material or information that is uploaded to, posted to or otherwise communicated by users on the Website (collectively, “Content”) at your own risk. The Website cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Therefore, the Website cannot and does not guarantee that Content you post on the Website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. The Website is not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your Content.</p>

<p class="{style.sectionDesc}">We make your contact information available to other users that you transact with on this site to help facilitate your interaction and language learning.</p>
<div class="{style.sectionHeader}">Links</div>
<p class="{style.sectionDesc}">The Website may contain links to other websites. The Website is of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. The Website encourages users to be aware when they leave the Website to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Website.</p>
<div class="{style.sectionHeader}">Third Party Advertising</div>
<p class="{style.sectionDesc}">Advertisements that appear on the Website are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third-party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. The Website does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on the Website unless you choose to share it with them.</p>
<p class="{style.sectionDesc}">This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by the Website and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>

<p class="{style.sectionDesc}">Users may modify or remove any of their account information at any time by logging into the My Profile page.  Information will be updated promptly. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Website account may do so on the My Profile page.</p>
<div class="{style.sectionHeader}">Protecting Information</div>
<p class="{style.sectionDesc}">The Website takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, the Website requests that you not send private information to us by email.</p>
<div class="{style.sectionHeader}">Changes in this Privacy Statement</div>
<p class="{style.sectionDesc}">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p class="{style.sectionDesc}">We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
